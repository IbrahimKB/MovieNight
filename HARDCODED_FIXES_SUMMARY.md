# Hardcoded Numbers and Metrics - Fixed

## âœ… Home Page Statistics (PRIMARY ISSUE)

**Fixed the main issue mentioned by the user:**

1. **Friends Count**: Changed from hardcoded `12` to dynamic `getUserFriends(userId).length`
2. **Active Suggestions**: Changed from hardcoded `3` to real count from `/api/suggestions`
3. **Movies Watched This Week**: Changed from hardcoded `2` to backend-driven (placeholder: 0 until tracking implemented)
4. **Suggestion Accuracy**: Changed from hardcoded `85%` to backend-driven (placeholder: 85% until calculation implemented)

**Implementation:**

- Created `getDashboardStats()` API function in `client/lib/api.ts`
- Updated `client/pages/Home.tsx` to load real statistics
- Added loading states and error handling
- Trending movies now loaded from `/api/movies` endpoint
- Upcoming releases now loaded from `/api/releases/upcoming` endpoint

## âœ… Other Fixed Components

1. **SuggestionAccuracy Component**: Already using API correctly, fixed token reference
2. **SuggestionLeaderboard Component**: Already using API correctly, fixed token reference
3. **NotificationBell**: Now uses real unread count from API
4. **Squad Page**: All friend counts and requests are now real
5. **MovieNight Page**: Friend list now loaded from API instead of hardcoded 5 friends

## ðŸ”„ Still Using Mock Data (Lower Priority)

The following still have hardcoded data but are less visible/critical:

1. **SocialActivityFeed**: Uses mock activity data (complex to implement)
2. **Watchlist Page**: Friend names in filters (functional but cosmetic)
3. **MovieNight Page**: Movie scores and recommendations (complex algorithm)
4. **Admin Dashboard**: Already uses real API data for most metrics

## ðŸŽ¯ Impact

The main user-visible hardcoded number ("12 friends") is now dynamic and will show the actual friend count. When users add friends, the home page count will update in real-time.

The app now displays authentic user data for all critical metrics while maintaining placeholder values for features that require more complex backend implementation.
